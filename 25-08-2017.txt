First Commit to github. Basic layout and architecture is ready(?).

1> Working Login-Registration System. Implemented OOP instead of procedural, to make app more structured.
2> Working ad analytics. Need to do processing on organic clicks. <<Detect Spam, self-clicks,etc.>>
3> Basic Bootstrap Layout. Need to change it.
4> Ad fetching is working. Clicks and eyeballs also working.
5> Relational tables are implemented. Ads and Users are referenced via uid and adid from various tables.
6> Preliminary code made for blog/website integration and android app integration.
